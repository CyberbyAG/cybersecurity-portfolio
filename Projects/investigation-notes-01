**Project:** Brute Force Detection using Windows Event Logs

## Objective

To detect signs of a brute force attack using Windows Security event logs and identify the attacker’s behavior based on log patterns.

---

## Tools Used

- Windows Event Viewer
- `Security.evtx` file from malware-traffic-analysis.net
- **Event IDs Analyzed:** 4625 (Failed Logon), 4740 (Account Lockout), 4624 (Successful Logon)
- Mitre Attack Framework

---

## Log Source

- `Security.evtx` – Collected from a Windows host during a simulated attack

---

## Step-by-Step Process

1. Downloaded and extracted `windows-event-logs.zip`.
2. Opened `Security.evtx` in Windows Event Viewer.
3. Applied a filter to show only Event ID **4625** (failed logon).
4. Identified repeated failed login attempts on the account `admin`.
5. Reviewed:
   - Target Account Name
   - Source IP Address / Workstation
   - Failure Reason
   - Time of Event
6. Counted the number of failed attempts within a short time window.
7. Check Event ID **4624** (Successful Logon) to check did the attacked got the access or not.
8. Searched for Event ID **4740** to confirm account lockout.
9. Cross-referenced activity with MITRE ATT&CK Technique [T1110 – Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/).
10. Drafted findings and recommendations in a report format.

## Key Indicators Found

- **User:** `admin`  
- **Repeated Event ID:** 4625  
- **Source IP:** `XX.XX.XX.XX`  
- **Account Lockout Detected:** Yes (Event ID 4740)

---

## Outcome

The log analysis confirmed a brute force attempt. The attacker failed to access the account, but the activity triggered an account lockout event. Recommendations were made to enhance authentication and monitoring.
